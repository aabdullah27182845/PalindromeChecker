# Palindrome Manager

This project was created with the use of many classes, counting up to 7 classes at the time of writing this file.
These classes are: InputManager, Main, PalCheck1, PalCheck2, PalCheck3, PalManager, and Splitter.
An interface called PalinInt was also created as a contract for the PalCheck# classes.

- The input manager deals with the user input for this program.
- PalCheck1, 2 and 3 all deal with different ways of confirming palindromes.
- PalinInt is an interface for the PalChecker classes.
- PalManager deals with storing all the palindromes into an ArrayList.
- Splitter class deals with splitting the sentence provided by the user into a list of all the words that appear in that sentence.
- Tests were written for the Palindrome Checkers and the PalManager. 

### Areas for improvement

There were certainly some things missing from the program and some things that weren't entirely used.

- More tests for different classes could be made.
- An input for the user can be taken to print out a specific palindrome.
